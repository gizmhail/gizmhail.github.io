<p>These dev aims at making the user feel the resistance of a saber they are holding in virtual reality, without dedicated haptic hardware, other than the classical controllers.</p>
<p>To do so, for one saber, I have in fact 2 sabers : </p>
<ul>
<li>one is the virtual reality version: it is a "normal" object, affected by the physics engine forces, blocked by other objects, ... </li>
<li>one is the "IRL" ghost version : it can be grabbed with your VR controllers, but it cannot be blocked by anything (kinematic rigid body, to be more precise). If you really had a saber in your real life hand, it would be located exactly where you see this object. Thanks to my collision matrix settings, those 2 object can't collide together (in fact, the IRL version can just interact with the hand objects, that's all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, "when needed" (ie when the VR saber is blocked, and so, out of sync with the IRL one), I apply forces so that the VR saber tries to join back the IRL one (and retrieve its orientation). I apply these force more or less at the grab position. And while the saber are not merged back, I make the controller vibrate, proportionally to the distance of the 2 saber version. To have a nice movements, for the moment I use an article by Digital Opus (http://digitalopus.ca/site/pd-controllers/) that explain how to have nice force based movements to a given position.</p>
<p>The magic is that our brain is tricked by 3 things :</p>
<ul>
<li>while the sabers are out of sync, the vibration is a bit unconfortable: we feel that there is a slight resistance, that our hand is not where it could normally be</li>
<li>the ghost saber make it acceptable anyway: we "see" our real hand, there is no "where is my hand ??" effect (It works even better as we can see where is the saber "IRL"...even if it does not exists)</li>
<li>... while the VR saber is where we would expect in the VR world we are immerged</li>
</ul>
